Code Coverage:
As per inputs we need to implement TDD :
I have created class and interfaces for implementing a Dependency Injection to moq and write a test cases for business logic instead of calling again api .However  do to limited time and time constraint i have not added Unity frame work to support the system of Dependency inject support , hence unable to write test cases for business class . i have implemented in my Project DI using Autofac
Btw I know how to write test cases. However due to time limit I am unable process further for test cases written
